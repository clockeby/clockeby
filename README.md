- 👋 Hi, I’m Camron Lockeby (@clockeby)
- 👀 I’m interested in people and the things they do with the products they use. Connecting, listening, traveling, learning, and designing to improve lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how CSS container queries can be used with CMS tools to deliver the right content to the right people with less effort from both parties. I'm also learning Spanish and to play the ukulele.🎓
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design systems, accessibility, and remarkable design.
- 📫 You can reach me at clockeby@gmail.com or try clockeby via linkedin, codepen, instagram, spotify, etc.
